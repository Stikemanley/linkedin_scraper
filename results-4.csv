140,ReferHire,Internet,New Delhi,Delhi,6,Privately Held,"ReferHire.com is a p2p social hiring network for the global professional community. We believe the future of recruiting is p2p, rather than the HR - Candidate interaction model facilitated by job boards today. 

Hiring today is a mess due to the nature of the HR - Candidate interaction model. Various process transparency problems exist due to the Recruiting team becoming a bottleneck under this process. Some examples are:

1) Majority of the jobs don't get advertised;
2) Most job applicants do not get a response back from HR;
3) More than 1/3rd of companies struggle to find the talent they need.

Our objective at ReferHire is to make this process truly collaborative and for organizations to hunt for talent as a team. When Company Employees become a key part of the Hiring process, it will allow organizations to make more jobs visible, promote those jobs across multiple networks, and build multi-level relationships with good candidates. Job Seekers can get visibility on hidden vacancies as well as critical information on the job role, interview process and career opportunities within their target organization.
In other words, by transforming the Hiring process from a HR – Candidate interaction model (as present job sites focus on) to a more peer to peer model (i.e. ReferHire), we believe this will greatly improve the overall hiring experience for all.

So join the ReferHire community and let’s make Hiring easier.

158,US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS),Research,Washington,DC,5167,Government Agency,"ARS enjoys deep-historic roots as the principal in-house research agency of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Federally-supported agricultural research dates back to the 1862 Organic Act, which established what is now the USDA. The Organic Act charged the then-Commissioner of Agriculture “To acquire and preserve… all information he can obtain by means of books and correspondences, and by practical and scientific experiments…” ARS was founded in 1963 with the vision of leading America towards a better future by fulfilling this charge through agricultural research and information.

ARS employs 2000 scientists and post-docs at over 90 locations across the country. Collectively, our scientists are engaged in almost 700 cutting-edge research projects at any given moment. Projects range from how to reduce nitrate runoff on Midwest farms, to best practices for Honey Bee management. The information, technology, and improved techniques originating in the ARS scientific community have profound and wide-ranging impacts on all consumers domestic and abroad.",http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/main.htm,"['Agricultural Research', ' Animal Production & Protection', ' Nutrition', ' Food Safety & Quality', ' Crop Production & Protection', ' Sustainable Agricultural Systems', ' International Agriculral Research', ' Pest Management Policy', ' and Scientific Communication']"
