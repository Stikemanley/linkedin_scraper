6,Simons Foundation,Research,New York City,New York,196,Nonprofit,"The Simons Foundation is a private foundation established in 1994 in New York City by Jim and Marilyn Simons. With an annual grants and programs budget of $300 million, the foundation’s mission is to advance the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.

The foundation pursues its mission through its grant-making division, comprising programs in Mathematics & Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, Education & Outreach and autism research, and through its internal research division, the Flatiron Institute.

FLATIRON INSTITUTE
The mission of the Flatiron Institute is to advance scientific research through computational methods, including data analysis, modeling and simulation.

New experimental techniques in many fields of study are creating enormous amounts of raw, complex and sometimes noisy data. Understanding and learning from these data and modelling the complex processes they reflect is a pressing concern in the scientific community. At the same time, advances in concepts, algorithms and computation are enabling new kinds of simulations that can capture rich nonlinear, and often time-dependent, processes. These simulations demand increased sophistication in scientific technique, algorithmic development and computation.

The Simons Foundation launched the Flatiron Institute to address these challenges, developing new conceptual, algorithmic and computational methods and bringing them to bear on important scientific issues. The institute provides a highly interactive research environment for physicists, biologists, astronomers, chemists, computational scientists, data scientists and programmers to work together to create, deploy, apply and support state-of-the-art computational methods.

The institute currently comprises the Center for Computational Biology, launched in 2013 as the Simons Center for Data Analysis; the Center for Computational Astrophysics, launched in 2016; and the Center for Computational Quantum Physics, launched in 2017. The work of these centers is supported by the Scientific Computing Core.

7,"TMT International Observatory, LLC",Research,Pasadena,CA,68,Nonprofit,"The TMT International Observatory, LLC (TIO) is a non-profit organization managing the development and construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, a large optical-infrared telescope to be built near the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii Island by an international partnership.

The observatory project office in Pasadena leads and coordinates the work at partner locations. The Members of TIO are Caltech, UC, the National Institutes of Natural Sciences of Japan, the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Atomic Energy of India, and the National Research Council (Canada); the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) is a TIO Associate. Major funding has been provided by the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation. 

The TMT will be one of the world’s largest ground-based optical/infrared telescopes, and will represent the forefront of technology in every aspect of its design:

* The structure will consist of a primary mirror with 492 individual 1.45-meter segments that together measure 30 meters in diameter, providing more than eight times the collecting area of the current largest telescope.

* All mirrored segments will be guided with precision computer control in order to work together as one single mirror, building on the technology developed for the 10-meter mirrors in the two Keck telescopes in Hawaii.

* Adaptive optics (AO) will allow the TMT to achieve a resolution superior to that of the Hubble Space Telescope, using six laser beams to create six luminous spots in a layer of sodium atoms high in Earth's upper atmosphere. These bright artificial stars serve as references for measuring the turbulence in the atmosphere, allowing the AO system to compensate for blurring of starlight by Earth's fluctuating atmosphere.

14,CCL Forensics,Security and Investigations,Stratford upon Avon,West Midlands,30,Privately Held,"CCL have established their position as a market leader over the past 30 years providing Digital Forensics, e-Disclosure & Cyber Security services in the UK and at an international level. They have developed these services due to market demand by utilising both commercial software packages & an advanced in-house R&D team. They can supply analysis in-line with existing working process but really excel when challenged with developing more complex capabilities around obscure & emerging technologies and applications. 

Their e-Disclosure services are the result of their experience in the world of digital forensics. A forensic approach ensures that crucial data is not overlooked & that evidence is defensible in court. It also ensures that metadata is preserved, which can prove critical to subsequent processing, indexing & the time line production of the data during review.

As businesses realise how central data is to their operations, so too comes the importance of cyber security in protecting this valuable asset. There is a common misconception that investment in sophisticated technical solutions will ensure protection from cyber-attacks. This is only one part of an effective defence. CCL’s cyber strategy takes organisations through the three stages of building an effective strategic response:
1. Assessing the threat & risk against organisational strategy to identify vulnerabilities
2. Taking protective action – prioritisation of mitigation against identified vulnerabilities to enhance security infrastructure & incident response
3. Monitoring & evaluating – initiate protective monitoring, testing & exercising to support effective remediation

CCL Forensics Ltd holds both ISO27001 & ISO9001 certification. They also hold the most comprehensive ISO17025 accreditation scope for the forensic extraction & analysis of data in the UK & have been recommended for the FSR's Codes of Practice & Conduct.
